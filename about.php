                your PG in rooms, hostel or apartments, we've got you covered with our web applications.

                having to worry about rent calculations, cause we will do it for you!<br>

                With PG Manager™, you can also track your PG's income and expenses, generate reports, send SMS and
                email notifications, manage staff and bookings, and list your PGs on our website.<br>
                We provide a better and efficient way to manage your PGs remotely. Everything you save is on our
                cloud. So you need not worry about losing your data ever again! <br>
